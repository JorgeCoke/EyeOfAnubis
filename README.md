## Description
The application uses facial recognition technology to track the eyes and de face position od the user. Once the face is tracked it is possible to use "eye-commands" to perform actions. Joining Android and Arduino via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)we can create a physical interface that alow us to use that "eye-commands" to all what we want (e.g. wheelchairs, drones, robots, boats, vehicles, mouse, etc...).
For this version we have code four possible commands (i.e. looking up, looking down, looking rigth and looking left). 

We have built a vehicle with two engines and a breadboard to try the performance of the eye tracker.
